# EZ Kanban

## Goal of This Project
To finish a React app in 90 days! I want to get better at working on personal projects in my free time, so the goal of this project is to get in the habit of doing just that. I want to prove to myself that I can complete an outside project without overworking.

## What is EZ Kanban
EZ Kanban provides all the functions a Kanban board **needs** with very few extras. You get the organization of a Kanban board minus all of the clutter from excessive features that similar apps provide. The app is geared towards simple or personal projects, where additional features may not be needed or may even get in the way of making a simple plan.

## Features
- Create boards
- Create lists within those boards
- Create items within the lists
- Move items between lists and boards
- Add colors to boards, lists, and items **This is an extra, but helpful for quick visualization :)*
